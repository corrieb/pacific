# vSphere with Kubernetes (AKA Project Pacific)

This repo will serve as a place for useful information on vSphere With Kubernetes feature in vSphere 7.0

It may well act as a staging place for content that ends up in offical VMware repos. If that's the case, I will make sure to link to them.

I have been deeply involved in this project and have contributed to the architecture and implementation of the following:
- Native pods
- Spherelet
- Resource management
- Glohal container image caching
- Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters
- Cluster API integation
